# Insights about fitness tracker data usage

## Description
This is a case study for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project.
In this project I play the role of a Data Analyst working on the Marketing Analyst team at Bellabeat.

## Business task

**Bellabeat** is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.

The company's products include wearable wellness trackers (such as Leaf, Time and Spring), the Bellabeat app and the Bellabeat membership.  
The Bellabeat app connects to the different smart devices and provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.

The purpose of this study is to analyze smart device usage data to discover how customers are already using their smart devices, these insights will help guide the marketing strategy for the company.  
By analyzing the usage frequency of the smart devices features, we can learn what users value the most and focus on how to improve the functionality and incentivize the usage of the least popular features for the Bellabeat app.

## Description of the data source used

The provided data was obtained from Kaggle: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)).  
Original source: Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A. (2016). Crowd-sourced Fitbit datasets 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.53894.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894)

The dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 2016-03-12 and 2016-05-12.   
Thirty eligible users (Mturker users of at least 18 years of age, who regularly wear a Fitbit) consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. 

*Full study details:* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28450274/  
*Fitabase Data Dictionary:* https://www.fitabase.com/media/1930/fitabasedatadictionary102320.pdf

The original data consists of 11 csv files in long format, containing records about calories, intensities and steps organized by hour and minute, activity by day; heartrate by seconds; and weightlog by day. 
7 additional csv files aggregating the data daily (4) and in a wide format (3) were included in Kaggle.
<hr>

By carefully reviewing and doing some research about that data I could determine that it was reliable, original and cited.   
However, for the purpose of my case study the data was not current (data from 7 years ago, when menstrual health tracking was not yet released by Fitbit) nor comprehensive, since the sample size was small and only represented the Fitbit users population. Moreover, the users gender was not specified and it would have been useful in this case, considering that Bellabeat is specialized in women health products.  
 
Therefore, in addition to the dataset provided, I would conduct a survey on the smart devices features, including Bellabeat and other brands smart device users from all genders to get an unbiased sample. 
Apart from gathering personal tracker data upon users consent, I would include a questionnaire about the smart devices features.  


## Documentation of data cleaning/manipulation 

Used Excel (Power Query) to do an initial exploration of the files and **Big Query** for data cleaning and manipulation.   
I found a total of **33** unique **users** and date range between **2016-04-12** and **2016-05-12** (instead of 30 users and date range between 2016-03-12 and 2016-05-12, as stated in the data source).

- Imported file with activity intensities by minute. Classified activity type according to score (0 - 3), grouped by activity type to get totals by day, reformated date column with correct date format. Created *daily_activity_clean* table.
- Imported file with steps by minute. Grouped steps by day, reformated date column. Created *daily_steps_clean* table.
- Imported weight log file. Grouped records by day, reformated date column, rounded columns with float numbers and replaced null values with 0. Created table as *weight_log_clean*.
- Imported file with heart rate by intervals of seconds. Grouped heart rate values by day to get a daily average, reformated date column. Created *daily_avg_heart_rate_clean* table.
- Imported file with daily sleep records, reformated date column and renamed other column. Created *daily_steps_clean* table.
- **Merged** all data together for analysis, joining all 5 tables (activity + steps + sleep + heart rate + weight log) and filling null values with 0.
- Checked for **duplicate records** (removed 3 duplicate rows), saved table as *all_features_clean*.
- Finally created a table with **all the feature**s including **all the dates** (33 users and 31 dates per user), filling the rows with no features data with 0 values. Saved table as *all_features_final*.


## Analysis

- Imported data from all features and merged them in one table with complete dates.
- Analyzed how many users are using each feature and the [total daily records per feature and user](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/daily_records_per_feature.csv).

| users_tracking_steps | users_tracking_sleep | users_tracking_weight | users_tracking_heart_rate | users_tracking_activity |
| :------------------: | :------------------: | :-------------------: | :-----------------------: | :---------------------: |
|          33          |          24          |          8            |             14            |            33           |

 
- For the **activity** feature only considered daily records where the total activity time summed up 1440 minutes (24hs) and where the total sedentary time was less than 1440 minutes, to exclude incomplete daily records.  

Analyzed users' physical activity level, classifying groups based on the [World Health Organization guideliness on aerobic physical activity] (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) as follows:

  - **Sedentary:** Less than 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week (or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of both).  
  - **Active:** Between 150 and 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week (or between 75 and 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of both).  
  - **Very Active:** Over 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week (or over 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of both).   

To simplify analysis, worked with daily average activity values (instead of weekly).   
See [Users' Physical Activity Level](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/activity_level.csv)

- Analized users' sleep profile by looking at the average, min and max time in bed vs time asleep by user.
 Noticed 8 outliers with insufficient and inconsistent data (less than 7 days of data with a high time variation).  
 See [Sleep Analysis](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/sleep_analysis.csv)

## Supporting visualizations and key findings


### Activity and Steps

- These are the **most popular** features: **all users** used these features **consistently** (for an average of 26 days).
- According to the physical activity level classification previously defined, **49%** of users are **very active**, **30%** are **sedentary** and **21%** are active.
- Wide range of daily average steps among users, with an average of almost 7000 steps a day. Users with over 7000 steps a day are physically very active or active.

### Sleep

- **24 users (73%)** tracked their **sleep**, for an average of 17 days. 
- The average time in bed was 7hs 22min vs 6hs 47min asleep, but if we remove the 8 outliers the **average time in bed** is **8hs 11min** vs **7hs 31min asleep**.

### Weight

- Only **8 users (24%)** logged their weight, **2** of them did it consistently. 
- Only **3** of these users used a **scale** to sync the data with the tracker (the other 5 entered the weight manually through the app).
- Only **2** records included body fat %.

### Heart Rate

- **14 users (42%)** tracked their **heart rate** but the **usage was consistent** (an average of 24 days). 
- **All except one** used this feature for **over 15 days**. 
- **35%** of these users did so for the entire period.

### Physical Activity Level

If we look at the **features usage** according to the **users' physical activity level**: 
- **Heart rate** and **weight** are mainly used by **active** and **very active** users (specially the latter).
- In average, the fitness tracker was used for **18 days** by **very active** users, **14 days** by **active** users and **13 days** by **sedentary** users.
