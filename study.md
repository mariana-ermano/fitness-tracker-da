# Insights about fitness tracked data usage

## Description
This is a case study for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project.
In this project I play the role of a Data Analyst working on the Marketing Analyst team at Bellabeat.

## Business task

Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.
The company's products include wearable wellness trackers (such as Leaf, Time and Spring), the Bellabeat app and the Bellabeat membership.
The Bellabeat app connects to the different smart devices and provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.

The purpose of this study is to analyze smart device usage data to discover how customers are already using their smart devices, these insights 
will help guide the marketing strategy for the company.
By analyzing the usage frequency of the smart devices features, we can learn what users value the most and focus on how to improve the functionality 
and incentivize the usage of the least popular features for the Bellabeat app.

## Description of the data source used

The provided data was obtained from Kaggle: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic))  
Original source: Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A. (2016). Crowd-sourced Fitbit datasets 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894

The dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 2016-03-12 and 2016-05-12. 
Thirty eligible users (Mturker users of at least 18 years of age, who regularly wear a Fitbit) consented to the submission of personal tracker data, 
including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

The original data consists of 11 csv files in long format, containing records about calories, intensities and steps organized by hour and minute, 
activity by day; heartrate by seconds; and weightlog by day. 7 additional csv files aggregating the data daily (4) and in a wide format (3) were included in Kaggle.

By carefully reviewing and doing some research about that data I could determine that it was reliable, original and cited. 
However, for the purpose of my case study the data was not current (data from 7 years ago, when menstrual health tracking was not yet released by Fitbit) nor comprehensive, 
since the sample size was small and only represented the Fitbit users population. Moreover, the users gender was not specified and it would have been useful in this case,
considering that Bellabeat is specialized in women health products.
 
Therefore, in addition to the dataset provided, I would conduct a survey on the smart devices features, including Bellabeat and other brands smart device users 
from all genders to get an unbiased sample. Apart from gathering personal tracker data upon users consent, I would include a questionnaire about the smart devices features.  


## Documentation of data cleaning/manipulation 

Used Excel (Power Query) to do an initial exploration of the files and Big Query for data cleaning and manipulation. 
I found a total of 33 unique users and date range between 2016-04-12 and 2016-05-12 (instead of 30 users and date range between 2016-03-12 and 2016-05-12, as stated in the data source).

- Imported file with activity intensities by minute. Classified activity type according to score (0 - 3), grouped by activity type to get totals by day, reformated date column with correct date format. Created daily_activity_clean table.
- Imported file with steps by minute. Grouped steps by day, reformated date column. Created daily_steps_clean table.
- Imported weight log file. Grouped records by day, reformated date column, rounded columns with float numbers and replaced null values with 0. Created table as weight_log_clean.
- Imported file with heart rate by intervals of seconds. Grouped heart rate values by day to get a daily average, reformated date column. Created daily_avg_heart_rate_clean table.
- Imported file with daily sleep records. Reformated date column and renamed other column.
- Merged all data together for analysis, joining all 5 tables (activity + steps + sleep + heart rate + weight log) and filling null values with 0.
- Checked for duplicate records (removed 3 duplicate rows), saved table as all_features_clean.
- Finally created a table with all the features including all the dates (33 users and 31 dates per user), filling the rows with no features data with 0 values. Saved table as all_features_final.
