# Insights about fitness tracker data usage

## Description
This is a case study for the Capstone Project of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.**      
In this project I play the role of a Data Analyst working on the Marketing Analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.


## Business task

**Bellabeat** is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.

The company's products include wearable wellness/fitness trackers (such as Leaf, Time and Spring), the Bellabeat app, and the Bellabeat membership.    
The Bellabeat app connects to the different smart devices and provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.

The purpose of this study is to **analyze smart device usage data** to discover how customers are already using their smart devices. These insights will help guide the **marketing strategy** for the company.    
By analyzing the **usage frequency** of the smart devices **features** we can learn what users **like** and **use** the most, and focus on how to **improve the functionality** and **incentivize the usage** of the least popular features on the Bellabeat app.

## Description of the data used

The provided data was obtained from Kaggle: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)).  
Original source: Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A. (2016). Crowd-sourced Fitbit datasets 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 [Data set]. Zenodo.  
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.53894.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894)

The dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 2016-03-12 and 2016-05-12.    
Thirty eligible users (Mturker users of at least 18 years of age, who regularly wear a Fitbit tracker) consented to the submission of personal data tracked by the fitness tracker, including minute-level output for **physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.**

*Full study details:* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28450274/  
*Fitabase Data Dictionary:* https://www.fitabase.com/media/1930/fitabasedatadictionary102320.pdf

The original data consists of 11 csv files in long format, containing records about calories, intensities and steps organized by hour and minute; activity and weightlog by day; heartrate by seconds.     
7 additional csv files aggregating the data daily (4) and in a wide format (3) were included in Kaggle.

By carefully reviewing and doing some research about that **data** I could determine that it was **reliable**, **original** and **cited**.     
However, for the purpose of my case study the data was *not current* (it was from 2016) *nor comprehensive*, since the sample size was small and only represented the Fitbit users population.     


## Documentation of data cleaning/manipulation 

I used Excel (Power Query) to do an initial exploration of the files and **Big Query** for data cleaning and manipulation.

See the **[SQL code for data cleaning and manipulation](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/data_cleaning.sql "Data cleaning and manipulation in SQL")** that I used in BigQuery.
   
I found a total of **33** unique **users** and a date range between **2016-04-12** and **2016-05-12** (instead of 30 users and date range between 2016-03-12 and 2016-05-12, as stated in the data source).

- Imported file with activity intensities by minute. Classified activity type according to score (0 - 3), grouped by activity type to get totals by day, reformated date column with correct date format. Created *daily_activity_clean* table.
- Imported file with steps by minute. Grouped steps by day, reformated date column. Created *daily_steps_clean* table.
- Imported weight log file. Grouped records by day, reformated date column, rounded columns with float numbers and replaced null values with 0. Created table as *weight_log_clean*.
- Imported file with heart rate by intervals of seconds. Grouped heart rate values by day to get a daily average, reformated date column. Created *daily_avg_heart_rate_clean* table.
- Imported file with daily sleep records, reformated date column and renamed other column. Created *daily_steps_clean* table.
- **Merged** all data together for analysis, joining all 5 tables (activity + steps + sleep + heart rate + weight log) and filling null values with 0.
- Checked for **duplicate records** (removed 3 duplicate rows), saved table as *all_features_clean*.
- Finally created a table with **all the feature**s including **all the dates** (33 users and 31 dates per user), filling the rows with no features data with 0 values. Saved table as *all_features_final*.


## Analysis

See the **[SQL code for data analysis](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/data_analysis.sql "Data analysis in SQL")** that I used in BigQuery.

- Analyzed [how many users are using each feature](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/tables_created_for_analysis/users_tracking_features.csv) and the [total daily records per feature and user](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/tables_created_for_analysis/daily_records_per_feature.csv).
- For the **activity** feature only daily records where both the total activity time summed up 1440 minutes (24hs), and the total sedentary time was less than 1440 minutes were considered, to exclude incomplete daily records.  

Analyzed users' physical activity level, classifying groups based on the [World Health Organization guidelines on aerobic physical activity](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) as follows:

  - **Sedentary:** Less than 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week (or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of both).  
  - **Active:** Between 150 and 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week (or between 75 and 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of both).  
  - **Very Active:** Over 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week (or over 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of both).   

To simplify analysis, worked with daily average activity values (instead of weekly).     
See [Users' Physical Activity Level](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/tables_created_for_analysis/activity_level.csv) query results.

- Analyzed users' sleep profile by looking at the average, min and max time in bed vs time asleep by user.  
 Noticed 8 outliers with insufficient and inconsistent data (less than 7 days of data with a high time variation).  
 See [Sleep Analysis](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/tables_created_for_analysis/sleep_analysis.csv) query results.

- Analyzed relation between users' physical activity level and sleep, and between the former and the fitness tracker degree of usage.  
 See [Analysis in Excel](https://github.com/mariana-ermano/fitness-tracker-da/blob/main/tables_created_for_analysis/physical_activity_analysis.xlsx).

### Activity and Steps

- These are the **most popular** features: **all users** used these features **consistently** (for an average of 26 days).
- According to the physical activity level classification previously defined, **49%** of users are **very active**, **30%** are **sedentary** and **21%** are active.
- Wide range of daily average steps among users, with an average of almost 7000 steps a day. Users with over 7000 steps a day are physically very active or active.

### Sleep

- **24 users (73%)** tracked their **sleep** for an average of 17 days. 
- The average time in bed was 7hs vs 6hs 17min asleep, but if we remove the 8 outliers the **average time in bed** is **7hs 41min** vs **7hs 4min asleep**.

### Weight

- Only **8 users (24%)** logged their weight, **2** of them did it consistently. 
- Only **3** of these users used a **scale** to sync the data with the tracker (the other 5 entered the weight manually through the app/website).
- Only **2** records included body fat %.

### Heart Rate

- **14 users (42%)** tracked their **heart rate** but the **usage was consistent** (an average of 24 days). 
- **All except one** used this feature for **over 15 days**. 
- **35%** of these users did so for the entire period.

### All features usage in relation to Physical Activity Level

- Only **3 users (9%) tracked all features**.
- Considering the fitness tracker usage as the total data points/records per user (including all features):
  Data shows that the fitness trackers were **mostly used** by **very active** users (average of 88 records per user), followed by **active** users (average of 68 records per user) and then by **sedentary** users (average of 64 records per user).
- **Heart rate** and **weight** are mainly used by **active** and **very active** users (especially the latter).
- Apart from the activity and steps features, the **sedentary** group preferred the **sleep** feature.


## Recommendations based on the analysis

Because of the data limitations (short time frame of tracked data and small sample of fitness trackers users, exclusively of Fitbit) it would be highly recommended to collect **additional data** from a [sufficient number of users](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/) of *different brands* of fitness trackers and smart devices (including Bellabeat). 

Considering that Bellabeat products are mainly focused on the *female audience*, it would also be useful to include users demographic information (especially *gender*) and data usage of *features exclusively used by women* (such as menstrual health tracking, which had not yet been released by Fitbit on 2016 so it could not be analyzed in this study).

With that being said, these are my conclusions and recommendations:

- The fitness trackers seem to be **used more consistently by physically active users** (unsurprisingly), but the less active ones still use them to track steps, activity and sleep.  
The marketing strategy could be geared towards physically active individuals, with the **main focus** on the **activity** and **steps** features (that seem to be the most popular ones), but encouraging healthy habits for the most sedentary users.

- Most of the users of the **sleep** feature seemed to have an adequate amount of sleep (within the [recommendations from CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html)) and were less than 1h awake during the night.     
This fact may indicate that this feature is not particularly used by individuals with sleep disorders and there doesn't seem to be a relation between the sleep duration and physical activity level.  
The advertisement of this feature may be targeted to a **wider audience**, it could be a good idea to promote sleep healthy habits by providing **tips for better sleep**.

- Users were reluctant to or not interested in tracking their **weight**, and the **few individuals** who logged this metric were predominantly **physically active** and entered the weight manually (just a few records were synced from a connected scale).  
As per the analysis and given the fact that body weight is a sensitive topic, not many people may want to get a reminder notification on the fitness tracker or app about using the scale or monitor their weight.  
Instead, the marketing strategy could be rather focused on providing **tips about healthy habits and nutrition** and informing women about **normal weight fluctuations** in their hormone cycle.       

- **Heart rate** was mainly tracked by **physically active individuals** and the daily usage was consistent.  
Promoting an [adequate amount of aerobic moderate intensity activity](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) through notifications/reminders on the fitness tracker and 
informing about the benefits that physical activity has on our health through recommended articles within the fitness tracker app, may encourage heart rate tracking during physical activity and increase awareness on heart health.
